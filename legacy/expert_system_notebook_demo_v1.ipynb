    "# Expert System (i.e. Knowledge-Based System) Shell/Engine - Educational DEMO\n",
    "Author: Ryan J Urbanowicz, PhD\n",

    "Institution: Cedars Sinai Health Sciences University\n",

    "This notebook includes code assembling a **basic but flexible expert system shell, built from the ground up** (i.e. without using existing expert system shells like CLIPS, clipspy, or PyKE), but certainly directly inspired by them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This expert system shell is primarily intended for educational purposes. While it is a realtively simple implementation it has been designed with a good deal of flexibility - not found in other Python or Java expert system implementations which are often confusing, not well documented, and or no longer supported/used often. This shell can be used to create a fairly wide varity of expert and knowledge-based system decision making/reasoning tools. Here is a summary of the key features of this shell impelemntation. \n",
    "1. Handles both **deductive** (certain) and **inductive** (uncertain/probabilistic) **reasoning**\n",
    "2. Can perform both **forward** and **backward chaining** (i.e. reasoning)\n",
    "3. Separates the knowledge base (saved as a json file) from the inference engine and other components (a simple knowlege base editor and a simple explanation system)\n",
    "4. Uses an easy-to-understand and simple syntax for facts, rules, and questions in the knoweldge-base (however potentially limiting for some applications)\n",
    "5. Flexibly handles truth comparisons including **(==, >, <, <=, >=,!=)** and fact-states such as True/False, yes/no, etc. \n",
    "6. For inductive reasoning - employs certainty factores (0-1 values) - rule firing propagates uncertainty with a product of cfs, while 'and's' of conjuntive rules take the minimum cfs across rule conditions. When multiple rules fire, certainty factors are combined with the Mycin cf update (i.e. new_cf = new_cf + old_cf * (1 - new_cf))\n",
    "7. The code in the shell below has also been adapted into a 'Streamlit' web dashboard/GUI that can be easily shared and played with. (i.e. **'expert_system_app.py'**)\n",
    "    * This dashboard is:\n",
    "        * Run with the command: **'streamlit run expert_system_app.py'**\n",
    "        * Limited to **backward chaining**.\n",
    "        * Allows loading of different knowlege bases as .json files.\n",
    "        * Requires selection of **deductive** vs. **probailistic** (i.e. inductive) reasoning before loading a knowelege base.\n",
    "        * Supports selection of certainty factors for inputs using a slider.\n",
    "        * Allows selection from available goals in knowledge base that can be proved.\n",
    "        * Provides a breakdown of reasoning, and an explanation of decisions."

    "## Introduction to Knowledge Base Syntax\n",
    "Below we explore simple expert systems designed as accessible examples.\n",
    "* Each knowlege base is stored within a .json file. \n",
    "* The .json knowlege base syntax is that of a dictionary organized by 'questions', 'facts' and 'rules'. Each type of entry has its own required syntax.\n",
    "    * 'questions' - a dictionary of key:value pairs where the key is the name of a fact needed by the system and the value is the text description of the input needed seen by the user.\n",
    "    * 'facts' - an array of objects (i.e. a list of dictionaries) where each fact has the keys (name, value, cf, explanation) identifying the fact name, it's assigned value, it's certainty factor, and a description of the fact (used by the explanation system)\n",
    "    * 'rules' - an array of objects (i.e. a list of dictionaries) where each rule has the keys (id, conditions, conclusion, cf, explanation) \n",
    "        * 'Conditions' are list objects that can include one or more conditions (to be satisfied) in order for the rule to 'fire' (i.e. add the conclusion as a new fact in the knowledge base)\n",
    "        * Each condition has two 'facts' that are compared using any of the following (==, >, <, <=, >=,!=). \n",
    "        * These 'facts' can either be variables (starting with '$') (which can also be defined as facts in the KB directly) or static (hard-coded) values within the condition itself, that the system will automatically turn into 'implied facts'. \n",
    "        * 'Conclusions' are given as a tuple that first defines the [fact name, fact value] when the rule fires.\n",
    "        * 'cf' and 'explanation' mean the same as for 'facts'\n",

    "This is a simple expert system designed to provide users guidance on 'what to bring' when leaving the house based on current weather conditions.\n",

    "* In this forward chaining example, only facts and rules are used (not questions).\n",
