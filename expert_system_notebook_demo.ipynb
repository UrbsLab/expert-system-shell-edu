    "# Expert System (i.e. Knowledge-Based System) Shell/Engine - Educational DEMO\n",
    "Author: Ryan J Urbanowicz, PhD\n",

    "Details: V4 - Extends backward chaining as a 'hybrid' option, also running forward chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes code assembling a **basic but flexible expert system shell, built from the ground up** (i.e. without using existing expert system shells like CLIPS, clipspy, or PyKE), but certainly directly inspired by them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This expert system shell is primarily intended for educational purposes. While it is a realtively simple implementation it has been designed with a good deal of flexibility - not found in other Python or Java expert system implementations which are often confusing, not well documented, and or no longer supported/used often. This shell can be used to create a fairly wide varity of expert and knowledge-based system decision making/reasoning tools. Here is a summary of the key features of this shell impelemntation. \n",
    "1. Handles both **deductive** (certain) and **inductive** (uncertain/probabilistic) **reasoning**\n",
    "2. Can perform **forward**, **backward**, and **hybrid chaining** (i.e. reasoning)\n",
    "3. Separates the knowledge base (saved as a json file) from the inference engine and other components (a simple knowlege base editor and a simple explanation system)\n",
    "4. Uses an easy-to-understand and simple syntax for facts, rules, and questions in the knoweldge-base (however potentially limiting for some applications)\n",
    "5. Flexibly handles truth comparisons including **(==, >, <, <=, >=,!=)** and fact-states such as True/False, yes/no, etc. \n",
    "6. For inductive reasoning - employs certainty factores (0-1 values) - rule firing propagates uncertainty with a product of cfs, while 'and's' of conjuntive rules take the minimum cfs across rule conditions. When multiple rules fire, certainty factors are combined with the Mycin cf update (i.e. new_cf = new_cf + old_cf * (1 - new_cf))\n",
    "7. The code in the shell below has also been adapted into a 'Streamlit' web dashboard/GUI that can be easily shared and played with. (i.e. **'expert_system_app.py'**)\n",
    "    * This dashboard is:\n",
    "        * Run with the command: **'streamlit run expert_system_app.py'**\n",
    "        * Limited to **backward chaining**.\n",
    "        * Allows loading of different knowlege bases as .json files.\n",
    "        * Requires selection of **deductive** vs. **probailistic** (i.e. inductive) reasoning before loading a knowelege base.\n",
    "        * Supports selection of certainty factors for inputs using a slider.\n",
    "        * Allows selection from available goals in knowledge base that can be proved.\n",
    "        * Provides a breakdown of reasoning, and an explanation of decisions."

    "    * 'rules' - an array of objects (i.e. a list of dictionaries) where each rule has the keys (id, conditions, conclusion, cf, explanation) \n",
